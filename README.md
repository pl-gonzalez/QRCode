# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to Front-End Mentor first challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

I used the mobile-first approach to complete this challenge. Then for me, the page is just a card in a body with 2 elements inside it, that is the QRCode and right below the description text 

## Deploying your project

I have some background in programming, so I will dont host this page, because of its simplicity
